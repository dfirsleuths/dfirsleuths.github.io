			<h4><strong>
			The Digital Corpora project was developed in response to a lack of available sources of digital forensics training material. This project aimed to address that concern by creating a plausible case scenario for students undertaking papers taught by the client. Below is the final scenario that the team decided on.
			</strong></h4>
			<br>
            <p>
              Due to intelligence provided by the Australian government, two passengers were intercepted by Customs upon arriving in Wellington, New Zealand from Brisbane. The Intel stated that Jane Esteban and John Fredricksen may be involved in illegal activity. 
			  The suspects were searched by a customs officer. John Fredricksen’s baggage consisted of clothing, toiletries and a Windows laptop. Jane Esteban's baggage also consisted of clothing, toiletries and a small windows laptop.
			</p>
	        <p>  
			  Upon further search of the lining of the suitcase, one kilogram of Methamphetamine was located.  Both suspects were taken into separate interview rooms where they were interrogated. John Fredricksen refused to answer any questions.
			</p>
			<p>
			  Jane Esteban stated all she knew was that she had to deliver the suitcase to the “Eastbourne library” but if all else failed then they were to deliver it to 666 Rewera Avenue, Petone as told by John.
			</p>
			<p>
			  Customs and police subsequently raided that address. There was nobody present at the address. Customs did, however, find drugs, guns and a desktop computer in the living room of the suspect's house.
			</p>
			<p>
			  You are a Customs forensics investigator. Customs officers have delivered images and memory dumps of the 2 laptops and 1 desktop computer to you. Your task is to carry out a forensic examination of John Fredricksen, Jane Esteban and the unknown suspect’s laptops and desktop computers to further understand their motives, goals and objectives. It should be noted that all three devices use different Windows 10 builds resulting in artefacts that may provide different information or may not be present.
